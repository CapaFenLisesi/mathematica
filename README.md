Mathematica
===========

This is a repository for mathematica notebooks.  Using a text version control system for Mathematica notebooks isn't ideal, but serves as a simple distributed backup.

Many of the notebooks in this repo are related to the undergrad physics courses that I'd taken:

notes/phy356
notes/phy450
notes/phy452
notes/phy454
notes/phy456
notes/phy485
