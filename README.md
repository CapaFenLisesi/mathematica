Mathematica
===========

This is a repository for mathematica notebooks.  Using a text version control system for Mathematica notebooks isn't ideal, but serves as a simple distributed backup.

Many of the notebooks in this repo are related to the undergrad physics courses that I'd taken:

   From University of Toronto 2011 PHY450H1S Relativistic Electrodynamics (taught by Prof Erich Poppitz)

phy452/

   From University of Toronto 2013 PHY452H1S Basic Statistical Mechanics (taught by Prof Arun Paramekanti)
